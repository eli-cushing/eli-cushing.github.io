# Using a Search Engine

This lab focuses on using a search engine effectively to troubleshoot an issue.

You will simulate resolving a problem where several users report their laptop cursor jumps around while typing.

1. **Start the Computer**:
   - If necessary, start your computer and sign in.

2. **Open the Browser**:
   - Launch Microsoft Edge or your preferred browser.
   - Optionally, explore changing the default search provider for Edge. To do so, ensure the search engine supports **OpenSearch** and visit its home page.

3. **Navigate to Google**:
   - Go to `google.com`. If redirected to a localized version, complete any wizards explaining Google's privacy and data collection policies if prompted.

4. **Optional: Change Search Engine**:
   - Click the **More Actions** (ellipsis) icon in Edge, then click **Settings**.
   - Go to **View advanced settings** and scroll to the "Privacy and services" section.
   - Click **Change search engine**, select **Google Search**, and click **Set as default** if you wish to change your default provider.

5. **Search for Initial Keywords**:
   - Type `laptop cursor jumps` into the address bar and press **Enter**.
   - Browse the results, noting:
     - Ad-supported sites explaining the issue.
     - Forum posts with similar issues.
   - Use the **Back** button to return to the search results or right-click links to open them in new tabs for review.

6. **Refine the Search**:
   - Type `hp laptop cursor jumps "windows 7"` into the search bar and press **Enter**.

7. **Compare Search Results**:
   - Open a new tab and search for `hp notebook cursor jumps "windows 7"`.
   - Compare the results and assess which search query provides more relevant solutions.

> Use browser tools to manage tabs and navigate efficiently.
>
> Look for forum discussions, support articles, or official documentation to pinpoint relevant fixes.

1. **Close All Tabs and Browser**:
   - After exploring the results, close all open tabs and exit the browser.

2. **Shut Down (Optional)**:
   - Shut down your computer if you are not continuing to use it after this lab.
