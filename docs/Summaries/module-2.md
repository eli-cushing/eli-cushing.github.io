# Module 2 / Summary

Using Apps and Databases  
In this module, you learned the basics of using a computer, Windows, and software applications.

# Module 2 / Unit 1 / Using Data Types and Units

- Computers process **binary data**, but this must often be converted to **decimal** or **hexadecimal** notation for use in programs and configuration dialogs.
- The fundamental **bit value** can be expressed in various multiples to describe storage and transfer rates (e.g., bits per second).
- Data must usually be declared as a particular **type** to be processed. Types include:
  - **Integers**
  - **Floating-point numbers**
  - **Boolean values**
  - **Char values**
  - **Strings** (which can use **ASCII** or **Unicode** representation).
- Data is a valuable asset and can be protected by legal mechanisms such as **copyright**, **patent**, and **trademark**.
- Consider the importance and use of **data and analytics** in defining business goals.

# Module 2 / Unit 2 / Using Apps

- Plan **software installation and upgrades** carefully:
  - Read the documentation.
  - Verify system requirements.
  - Check compatibility.
- Make sure you understand the implications of installing **commercial**, **freeware**, and **shareware** software.
- Be aware of the functions and features of **productivity**, **collaboration**, and **business software**.

# Module 2 / Unit 3 / Programming and App Development

- Software development often progresses through:
  - A **sequence or flow chart** of steps.
  - To **pseudocode**.
  - To fully developed **code** written in the syntax of a particular programming language.
- Some programming languages require **compiling** before programs can run, while others (e.g., scripting languages) run in an **interpreter** and compile at runtime.
- Other types of languages include **query**, **markup**, and **assembly** languages.
- Key programming elements include:
  - **Identifiers** such as variables and constants.
  - **Containers** such as arrays and vectors for data manipulation.
  - **Branches** and **loops** to allow deviation from an end-to-end run path.
- **Procedures and functions** enable reusable pieces of code. **Object-oriented techniques** help design robust code.
- Applications can be packaged for:
  - **Standalone installation** on a single computer.
  - **Network-hosted** or **cloud-hosted** architectures, which are becoming more popular.

# Module 2 / Unit 4 / Using Databases

- Understand the structure of **relational databases** and the processes of:
  - Creation.
  - Import/input.
  - Storage.
  - Querying.
  - Reporting.
- **Flat file systems** (e.g., Microsoft Excel) can handle small volumes of data and support one or two users.
- **RDBMS-based databases**:
  - Typically support **SQL**.
  - Scale well to support high numbers of users and transactions.
  - Be aware of **semi-structured datastores**.
- Know the typical **data definition** and **data modification commands** and understand the basics of **database permissions** and **access methods**.
- Consider how **application architecture** can use tiers to separate:
  - **Data**.
  - **Presentation**.
  - **Application layers**.
