# Module 1 / Summary

Using Computers  
In this module, you learned the basics of using a computer, operating system, and software applications. You also learned some best practices to follow when troubleshooting a problem or obtaining technical support.

- **Computer functions** can be described as belonging to one of input, output, processing, and storage. Make sure you can identify the type of function performed by PC components.
- Different types of **computing devices** include desktops/workstations, laptops, servers, smartphones, and tablets. Computing and networking functions are also being incorporated into **"Internet of Things"** appliances and objects.

# Module 1 / Unit 2 / Using a Workstation

- When installing computer equipment, work methodically and refer carefully to system documentation and installation guides.
- You learned about the main **Windows user interfaces** and how to navigate around the Windows desktop and Start Screen or Start Menu using a keyboard, mouse, or touchpad.

# Module 1 / Unit 3 / Using an OS

- The main functions of an **operating system** are to act as a user interface, provide a common platform for applications, and provide system and file maintenance tools.
- There are different types of operating systems for different devices and commercial models:
  - **Windows**: A commercial operating system available in various editions with different features.
  - **Apple Mac OS** and **Linux** (open source), plus **Google Chrome** for desktops.
  - **Mobile OSs**: Windows Mobile, iOS, and Android.
- **Virtualization** allows a single host computer to run multiple guest operating systems or Virtual Machines (VMs). The VMs are managed by a **hypervisor**.
- You also learned how to:
  - Use **File Explorer** to browse the file system and network locations.
  - Access **Settings/Control Panel** to adjust settings in Windows.
  - Use a **web browser** to view websites.

# Module 1 / Unit 4 / Managing an OS

- In addition to user interfaces for navigating software and files stored on the OS, there are **management interfaces** for performing configuration.
- You learned how to use tools to perform different management tasks, such as processes, memory, disks, and scheduling.
- A **Command Line Interface (CLI)** allows control of the OS without a GUI. There may be more than one CLI included with an OS, and the commands supported will vary.
- The user who installs an OS typically becomes the **administrator account** with complete control over system settings. Use **standard accounts** for day-to-day use of the computer.

# Module 1 / Unit 5 / Troubleshooting and Support

- You should try to learn the steps and sequence of the **CompTIA troubleshooting model**.
- Make sure you can recognize **common external issues** and be aware of the consequences, such as the risk of data loss or service loss, and measures to reduce them.
- If there is a problem with hardware or software:
  - Be aware of the various **sources of assistance** and information available for resolving it.
  - Learn to use a **search engine effectively**, including advanced search tools or query syntax.
