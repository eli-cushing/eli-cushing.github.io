# Review

1. What shows the structure of code without using the specific syntax of any one language?

   > Pseudocode.
   [Writing Pseudocode](../../Lab/Modules/Module-2.md#313-writing-pseudocode)

2. What is an interpreted language?

   > Interpreted languages do not need to be compiled. They run within the context of an interpreter, which converts the code to machine code during runtime.
   [Interpreted  Languages](../../Lab/Modules/Module-2.md#322-interpreted-languages)

3. How is a markup language different from a compiled language?

   > Markup doesn't provide instructions for the CPU to run. It uses nested tags within a document to describe its structure and contents.
   [Markup Languages](../../Lab/Modules/Module-2.md#325-markup-languages)

4. What are constants and variables examples of?

   > Programming identifiers.
   [Identifiers](../../Lab/Modules/Module-2.md#identifiers)

5. What type of programming concept allows for a variable size container?

   > A vector is a variable size container, while an array is fixed size.
   [Containers](../../Lab/Modules/Module-2.md#containers)

6. You want to check whether a condition has been met, and if it has, perform one action. Otherwise, you want your program to perform a second action. What sort of programming operation would help achieve this?

   > A conditional branch, such as an If...Then statement.
   [Branches](../../Lab/Modules/Module-2.md#branches)

7. In a program, what does a loop do?

   > A loop performs one or more instructions until (or while) a condition is met.
   [Loops](../../Lab/Modules/Module-2.md#loops)

8. What is the difference between a procedure and a function?

   > A procedure performs an action, while a function performs an action and returns a value to the main program.
   [Procedures and Functions](../../Lab/Modules/Module-2.md#procedures-and-functions)

9. What three things define an object?

   > Properties, attributes, and methods.
   [Object-Oriented Programming](../../Lab/Modules/Module-2.md#object-oriented-programming)
