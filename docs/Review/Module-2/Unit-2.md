1. What compatibility information should you confirm before installing a software application?

   > That it works with the version of Windows that you have and that your computer meets the system (hardware) requirements [Installing Applications](../../Lab/Modules/Module-2.md#21-installing-applications)

2. Following installation of a program written for an older version of Windows, you receive an alert that it might not have installed correctly. What feature could you use to make the program run correctly?

   > Use the program's Compatibility tab to use settings for the older Windows version. [Configuring Application Compatibility](../../Lab/Modules/Module-2.md#221-configuring-application-compatibility)

3. Why would Windows prompt you to enter a password if you try to install a software application?

   > Installing an application requires administrator privileges and is an action protected by User Account Control. If you were logged on as an administrator already, you might have to enter the password on a domain; if you were logged on as an ordinary user, you would have to enter the administrator's user name and password. [Installing a Desktop Application](../../Lab/Modules/Module-2.md#212-installing-a-desktop-application)

4. Windows comes with web server software but it is not enabled by default. How would you install this software?

   > Use the Turn Windows features on or off dialog from Programs and Features. [Enabling and Disabling Windows Features](../../Lab/Modules/Module-2.md#223-enabling-and-disabling-windows-features)

5. Following installation of an application, another program on your computer has stopped working. What could you do to try to fix it?

   > Try using the Repair option in Programs and Features (if available) or re-installing the program. [Repairing and Uninstalling Software](../../Lab/Modules/Module-2.md#222-repairing-and-uninstalling-software)

6. Why might one of your first tasks on receiving a new computer be to remove software applications?

   > The computer may be bundled with pre-installed software that you do not want.

7. In order to obtain support, the software vendor wants to know the application's product ID. How would you locate this information?

   > Usually via the Help > About menu. [Software Licensing and Agreements](../../Lab/Modules/Module-2.md#231-software-licensing-and-agreements)

8. What is the difference between freeware and open source software?

   > Open source means the programming code used to design the software is also made available (and you must make it available in turn if you sell or distribute any part of it). Freeware means the software product costs nothing to use, but this does not mean that the code is made available or that you could modify the software and distribute it yourself. [Shareware, Freeware and Open Source Applications](../../Lab/Modules/Module-2.md#234-shareware-freeware-and-open-source-applications)

9. What type of software would you use to configure a server by connecting to it over the network?

   > Remote Desktop. [Remote Desktop and Screen Sharing Software](../../Lab/Modules/Module-2.md#253-remote-desktop-and-screen-sharing-software)

10. What type of software manages tasks, dependencies, and timelines?

    > Project management software. [Project Management](../../Lab/Modules/Module-2.md#264-project-management)
