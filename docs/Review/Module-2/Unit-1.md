# Review

1. Which notation system supports presenting the largest numbers using the fewest digits: Binary, Decimal, or Hexadecimal?

   > Hexadecimal. Each hex digit can store 16 bits of information. A single decimal digit stores 4 bits while binary obviously stores 1 bit.

2. What is the decimal number 75 in binary and hexadecimal?

   > `0100` `1011` in binary and 4B in hex. Hex notation is often indicated using `0x` to precede the hex digits, so you may see this written like `0x4B`. To work out the answer without a calculator, write out the place values for each notation system. For binary you'd have columns for 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, and 1 and put a 1 in each column you need to add up to 75 and a 0 in the others. For hex you only need 16 and 1 (75 divided by 16 is 4 remainder 11, which is represented as "B" in hex).

3. Which data type provides for whole numbers only?

   > Integer.

4. What is the difference between the char and string data types?

   > Char stores a single textual character in a fixed-length field (typically 1 byte). A string is a variable-length field for storing a sequence of characters.

5. Which data representation format can encode the widest range of characters?

   > Unicode can represent millions of characters (glyphs). ASCII's 7-bit data structure can only support 128 characters, some of which are non-printable control characters.

6. What type of legal protection could be obtained for a novel software algorithm?

   > Patent provides the best protection as it can enforce ownership even if someone tries to write the algorithm in a slightly different way. Software code is often protected both by patent and by copyright however.

7. What data protection technology could you implement in order to restrict the type of activity that users could employ on digital products that they have purchased or rented?

   > Digital Rights Management (DRM).

8. What part of the process of data analytics is most closely supported by meaningful reporting?

   > Insights are the "end product" of the analytic process. Humans need a suitable reporting format to make best use of insights.
