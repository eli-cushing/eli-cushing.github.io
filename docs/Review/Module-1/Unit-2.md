# Review

1. What should you do before attempting to set up a new computer system?

   > Verify that the environment is suitable and that the installation will be safe.

2. When setting up a desktop computer, what factor should you consider when deciding on the location of the system case?

   > You do not want to leave trailing wires over walkways, so consider the position of power outlet(s) and where peripheral devices will be placed. Also, ensure adequate air flow around the system unit.

3. What factors should you consider when positioning input and output devices?

   > Ensure they can be used without exerting strain, especially on the arms/wrists and back/neck. Make sure cabling is not a trip hazard and avoid locations that cause excessive screen glare.

4. You have to sign in to Windows—does it matter if the CAPS LOCK light on the keyboard is activated?

   > Yes—passwords are case-sensitive.

5. You have to open a word processing application but you cannot see an icon on the desktop. What should you do?

   > Look for the shortcut in the Start Menu or Start Screen—not all programs add shortcuts on the Desktop.

6. Your colleague has to run many applications at the same time and finds it difficult to know which icon to choose when switching between them. What alternative method could you suggest?

   > Press Alt+Tab—this shows previews of the windows. Windows can also show previews of the window contents when pointing at the taskbar icon.

7. Your colleague is using a laptop and you notice that he laboriously clicks the mouse repeatedly to scroll through the document you are co-editing. What technique could he use to be more productive?

   > Use the mouse scroll wheel (or, if it doesn't have one, drag the scroll button in the scroll bar).
