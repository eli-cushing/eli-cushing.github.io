1. True or false? All types of computers use CPU and system memory

   > True

2. What type of computer is most likely to need peripheral devices?

   > Desktop computerâ€”you could also call this a Personal Computer (PC) or a workstation. An All-in-one PC also uses peripheral devices, with the obvious exception of a monitor.

3. What type of computer is best suited for using in a job where you have to make notes and be able to move around easily?

   > A tablet or smartphone or possibly a hybrid laptop/tablet. Note-taking is supported by a touchscreen-based device.

4. Why don't laptops make good servers?

   > There is no room for expansion you are paying for components and design (maximum portability) you do not need.

5. Why isn't a smartphone a good tool for writing a report?

   > Touchscreen or mini keyboards are not optimized for writing lots of text, though it is possible to attach them as peripheral devices.

6. What type(s) of IoT appliance are less likely to be controlled via a home automation hub?

   > Modern cars and medical devices are unlikely to interface via a hub. Home automation hubs link to kitchen and domestic appliances, streaming media players, and potentially security systems.
