# Review

1. You are advising a colleague about best practices when troubleshooting. You have identified the following techniques to use to identify a problem: gather information, duplicate the problem, question users, identify symptoms, and approach multiple problems individually. If you are following CompTIA's troubleshooting model, what other piece of advice should you give?

   > Determine what has changed (this is the most useful troubleshooting technique).

2. You have asked a senior manager to authorize your plan of action for resolving a fault in a software application. What name is given to the process you are following?

   > This is escalating the problem. You might escalate a problem to more experienced staff or seek help with a solution plan that is beyond your authority to put into action.

3. You are setting up a new computer, but it doesn't seem to be working. Should you check anything or contact the manufacturer?

   > It would be best to double-check you have connected the cables correctly (especially power).

4. Your computer locks up periodically and feels hot to the touch. Could these things be related?

   > Yes, many lockup problems are caused by overheating. The first step would be to clean the fan exhaust vents of dust.

5. What crucial piece of information would you need when trying to locate support information about a computer system on the manufacturer's website?

   > The model number or a service code.

6. If you do not have a support contract, what is likely to be the best option for obtaining advice about a problem with an application?

   > A product support or community forum.

7. You are looking for content on a topic but your search is returning millions of matches that are not particularly helpful. What two methods could you use to get better search results?

   > Use more search keywords (ideally with 'uncommon' words) or search for an exact phrase by enclosing it in quotes.

8. You want to find something on a particular website, but the site does not have a search tool. Could you use a general search engine, and if so, how?

   > Yesâ€”you use an advanced search form or use the site: operator (for example 'certification site:comptia.org').
